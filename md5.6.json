While all sentences end with \"half-life\", they are semantically nonsensical. \"Half-life\" is a specific term referring to the time taken for a quantity (usually of a radioactive substance or drug) to reduce by half, and it doesn't fit the contexts of beauty, enthusiasm, or memories. Many sentences are also grammatically incorrect by substituting a noun phrase for an adjective or other concept.\nHere's why:\n1. \"The beauty of the cherry blossoms is truly half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n2. \"His initial burst of enthusiasm proved half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n3. \"Fashion trends are often quite half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n4. \"The mayfly's existence is famously half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n5. \"She cherished the memory, knowing it was half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n6. \"Youthful dreams can sometimes be half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n7. \"The magic of the first snow is wonderfully half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n8. \"Their joy, though intense, felt half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n9. \"The delicate scent of the flower was half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n10. \"He wrote poetry about moments that are half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n11. \"The artist captures the fleeting and half-life.\" - Grammatically incomplete and nonsensical.\n12. \"A soap bubble's existence is beautifully half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n13. \"The peace treaty turned out to be half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n14. \"These feelings of despair, I hope, are half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n15. \"The effects of the drug were strong but half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n16. \"That shooting star was quick, bright, and half-life.\" - Nonsensical.\n\n------------\ncorrected list:\n1. Carbon-14 has a very long half-life.\n2. The medication has a short biological half-life.\n3. After one half-life, 50% of the substance remains.\n4. Scientists accurately measured the isotope's half-life.\n5. This element's decay is characterized by its half-life.\n6. The concept of half-life is crucial in nuclear physics.\n7.
