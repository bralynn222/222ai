The Task Given was:code mario in a python script for me= # --- Game Design Plan: Simple Mario Clone ---\\n#\\n# 1. **Game Concept:**\\n# A basic 2D side-scrolling platformer inspired by early Super Mario games.\\n# The player controls Mario, navigating levels by running and jumping.\\n#\\n# 2. **Core Mechanics:**\\n# * **Player Movement:**\\n# * Horizontal: Left and Right movement with constant speed.\\n# * Vertical: Jumping with an initial upward velocity, affected by gravity.\\n# * **Physics:**\\n# * Gravity: Constant downward acceleration affecting player and enemies.\\n# * Collision Detection:\\n# * Player vs. Platforms: Stop movement, allow standing on top.\\n# * Player vs. Enemies: Stomp on top to defeat; side collision results in damage.\\n# * Enemies vs. Platforms: Basic walking and turning at edges/walls.\\n# * **Enemy AI (Goomba):**\\n# * Simple patrol behavior: Moves horizontally, turns around at ledges or walls.\\n# * Defeated by stomping: Changes appearance (squishes) and then disappears.\\n# * **Level Progression:**\\n# * Player can enter pipes (when standing on top and pressing 'Down') to advance to the next level.\\n# * **Lives & Game Over:**\\n# * Player starts with a set number of lives.\\n# * Losing a life: Player takes damage (e.g., hits an enemy, falls off-screen), level resets (player position, enemies).\\n# * Game Over: Occurs when lives reach zero. Option to restart.\\n#\\n# 3. **Key Entities & Objects:**\\n# * **Player (Mario):** The controllable character. Represented by a red rectangle.\\n# * **Platforms:**\\n# * Ground: Solid green rectangles.\\n# * Blocks: Solid brown rectangles.\\n# * **Enemies (Goomba):** Simple brown rectangular enemy.\\n# * **Pipes:** Dark green rectangular objects that act as level exits/entrances. Also solid platforms.\\n#\\n# 4. **Levels:**\\n# * Two predefined levels designed using a simple character-based map (e.g., 'G' for ground, 'E' for enemy).\\n# * Level 1: Basic introduction with ground, a Goomba, and a pipe.\\n# * Level 2: Slightly more complex layout with blocks and ground.\\n#\\n# 5. **Camera:**\\n# * A simple scrolling camera that follows the player's horizontal and vertical movement.\\n# * Clamped to stay within the level boundaries.\\n#\\n# 6. **User Interface (UI):**\\n# * Display player's remaining lives.\\n# * \"Game Over\" screen with a \"Restart\" button.\\n#\\n# 7. **Controls:**\\n# * Left Arrow Key: Move player left.\\n# * Right Arrow Key: Move player right.\\n# * Space Bar / Up Arrow Key: Player jump.\\n# * Down Arrow Key: Enter pipe (when conditions are met).\\n#\\n# 8. **Goal:**\\n# * Navigate through the levels, avoid or defeat enemies, and reach the exit pipe of the final level.\\n#\\n# --- End of Game Design Plan ---\\n# Part 1/12 complete -
